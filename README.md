# Bet Game - Player vs Banker

A simple command-line game where you choose who will win — the **Player** or the **Banker**. Bet your virtual cash, make your prediction, and see if luck is on your side!

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. You start with a fixed amount of virtual cash.
2. Choose who you think will win: `Player` or `Banker`.
3. Place your bet.
4. The game will randomly determine the winner.
5. If you're right, you double your bet. If not, you lose the amount.
